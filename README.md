# Arkanoid

You can play this game here: [a.kaminski.software](https://a.kaminski.software/).

## Why

This is a learning project. I try to learn something more about js and understand how it works. In order to achive this I'm creating simple Arkanoid game without use of any frameworks nor external libraries. Feel free to leave [an issue](https://github.com/Pawilonek/Arkanoid/issues/new) if you see any room for improvements.
